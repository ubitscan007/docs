# Media Block Network Coin Governance

Media Block Network Coin is already a signigicantly decentralized platform and plans are in motion to achieve full community control over it in the future. Its governance is currently split among the following actors:

1\) **Network Validators.** Media Block Network Coin validators are entrusted with deciding whether to adopt [Media Block Network Coin improvement proposals](https://doc.mediablock.ai/general/fips) \(FIPs\).  Currently, every validator has one vote regardless of their share of the overall network stake but this is likely to change soon.

2\) **Media Block Network Coin Foundation and the project team**. Like most public blockchain projects at the initial stage of development, the development of the core network protocol and the Media Block Network Coin treasury that mostly consists of the undistributed genesis Media Block Network supply \(see the subsection "[Media Block Network Supply and Current Distribution](https://doc.mediablock.ai/general/Media Block Network-token/Media Block Network-supply-and-current-distribution)"\) are currently mostly managed by a foundation. For Media Block Network Coin, this role is played by Gibraltar-incorporated company Media Block Network Coin Limited.

Media Block Network Coin Foundation employs the Media Block Network Coin project team whose members' profiles can be found [here](https://mediablock.ai/about).

The project team implements network protocol updates adopted by the validators, other protocol changes that do not require validator votes, node software. It develops the mobile-centric infrastructure for creating and managing token communities on Media Block Network Coin. It also works on boosting the adoption of the network through improving the Media Block Network Coin tech stack, securing new partnerships and integrations, onboarding ecosystem projects and marketing the platform within the crypto space and beyond.  

3\) **Media Block Network Coin Assembly.** See the Assembly [page](https://doc.mediablock.ai/general/Media Block Network-governance/Media Block Network-assembly) for more details.
