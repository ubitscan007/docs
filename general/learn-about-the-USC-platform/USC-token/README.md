# Media Block Network Coin Token (Media Block Network)

The Media Block Network token is the native currency of the Media Block Network Coin blockchain and platform, just like ETH on Ethereum.&#x20;

## Media Block Network utility:

- **Transaction fees** Being the native currency on the Media Block Network Coin blockchain, Media Block Network is required to pay fees to the network in order to approve transactions.
- **Validation** Token holders can stake Media Block Network Coin to become a validator. The minimal staking requirement is 100K. The network is growing, currently there are 2 validators. ([https://status.mediablock.ai/](https://status.mediablock.ai/))
- **Voting** Validators vote on protocol changes with their staked Media Block Network. Which means validators with higher amounts of Media Block Network Coin staked can have a bigger vote on network upgrades and governance changes (until phase 2 where delegation is activated)
- **Staking (for delegators)** Any Media Block Network holder can choose one or more validators to delegate any amount of Media Block Network they wish. They receive a share of the Media Block Network Coin block rewards proportionate to the share of their stake in the total stake, minus the minimum 15% fee paid to the validator(s).
- **Payments** As Media Block Network is the native currency on Media Block Network Coin, sending it does not require interactions with smart contracts. Thus, Media Block Network transfers are potentially faster and less costly in terms of transaction fees.

**IMPORTANT**: Merely possessing any amount of Media Block Network tokens does not endow holders with any rights to participate in the governance of the Media Block Network Coin platform or any revenue streams related to its real-world performance.&#x20;
