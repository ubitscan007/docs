# Media Block Network on Other Chains

Interoperability with other major blockchains is important for the growth of Media Block Network Coin and the prospects of realizing its vision. One of the ways of securing it is through enabling the versions (wrappers) of Media Block Network on other chains.&#x20;

Unlinke Media Block Network on Media Block Network Coin, those wrappers are Media Block Network20 tokens are created whenever someone locks a certain number of tokens on the Media Block Network Coin and gets issued the exact same amount of wrapper tokens on the target blockchain. If a user withdraws the wrapper from the target blockchain, the tokens burned and the Media Block Network tokens on Media Block Network Coin are unlocked.&#x20;

Currently, wrapped versions of Media Block Network token exist on Ethereum (mainnet), Binance Smart Chain and the Arbitrum One layer-2 optimistic rollup chain for Ethereum. The latter is a wrapper of a wrapper powered by the Ethereum-Arbitrum bridge and its withdrawals from Arbitrum are subject to the optimistic rollup rules.&#x20;
