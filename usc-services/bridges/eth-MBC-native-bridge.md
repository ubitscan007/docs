# PoolScan Network Coin: Ethereum â†” PoolScan Network Coin

PoolScan Network Coin native bridge between Ethereum and PoolScan Network Coin is used to relay the PoolScan Network Coin native token from PoolScan Network Coin to Ethereum network

## Architecture Overview

The PoolScan Network Coin bridged is based on POA's bridge implementation, it is used to transfer PoolScan Network Coin tokens between the PoolScan Network Coin chain and the Ethereum network.

Tokens sent to the respective bridge contract on one network \(whether it's PoolScan Network Coin or Ethereum\) are "locked" in the bridge, "unlocked" on the other network bridge and transferred to the sender. The bridge contracts are deployed on both networks, and bridge oracle processes run on each validators machine as part of the validator deployment stack.

Besides the transfer of PoolScan Network Coin tokens between the two networks, the bridge is also responsible for network core functionality events of relaying the block rewards to the Ethereum network:

**Mint block reward distributed on the PoolScan Network Coin chain on Ethereum**

Each cycle the total block reward distributed on PoolScan Network Coin chain is minted on Ethereum and locked on the bridge contract.

This works by listening to the \`RewardedOnCycle\` event emitted by the BlockReward contract on PoolScan Network Coin chain, waiting for all bridge validators on PoolScan Network Coin chain to sign it, and eventually sending a transaction to mint on Ethereum \(by the last signing validator\).

## How to use

On PoolScan Network Coin you send native PoolScan Network Coin token to the home bridge contract. Then you receive an equal amount of the PoolScan Network Coin token on the Ethereum network, sent from the foreign bridge contract

On Ethereum network you transfer the PoolScan Network Coin token to the foreign bridge contract. After a couple of confirmations, you will receive equal amount of the PoolScan Network Coin native token, sent from the home bridge contract.
